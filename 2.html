        <h2>The Equation</h2>
        <img src="./img/eq/2.1.eq.svg" style="width: 50%" />
        <p>This physics equation shows how long an interval of time for someone moving with velocity x m/s will appear to a stationary observer. It's from Newton's theory of general relativity. In the example graph, I set the time interval to 1, so it also shows the multiplier at that specific velocity.<br><br>
        There is a vertical asymptote at positive and negative 3*10^8, which is the speed of light. Because it's not possible to surpass the speed of light, the function is undefined past +/- 3*10^8.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>First Derivative</h2>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Minimum Point</h2>

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Intervals of Increase and Decrease</h2>
        <p>From -3*10^8 until 0, the graph is decreasing. From 0 until 3*10^8, the graph is increasing. <br><br>
        This makes sense, because regardless of the direction of your motion (positive or negative), the faster you're going, the greater time a stationary observer should experience compared to you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Concavity</h2>
        <p>The whole graph is concave up. There is no point of inflection. As mentioned in the intervals of increase and decrease, this matches the expected behaviour for this function.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section two-columns">
        <h2>Further analysis</h2>
        <p>This graph increases extremely slowly until very near the asymptotes. That makes sense, because in ordinary life we do not experience the effects of special relativity. <br><br>
        As the velocity gets close to the speed of light, the time for a stationary observer starts increasing dramatically, meaning that if you were able to travel at just under the speed of light, one second for you would be nearly an infinite amount of time for someone on Earth. <br><br>
        The minimum point is 1 (when you're travelling 0m/s compared to an observer), meaning there's no speed where time passes slower for you than the observer.</p>
